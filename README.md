## Description

Thrown together in 10 minutes, all this does is enable Windows Update if it's disabled and atleast tries to delete some old files related to it.
Originally made this so I can run [eXPerience](http://experience.noncities.com/) on my secondary PC.

- Profit
- *It is recommended you get Driver Booster just in case.*
